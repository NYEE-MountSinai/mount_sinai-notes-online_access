 <br>Note
This test is to calibrate the Pressure Flow (PF) relationship.<br>
It is not indicative of the actual setup that the MiDOC will be used in!<br>
That test will be done later
<br><br>Develop a relationship between PDiff (P4-P3) and the flow reported by the flow sensor<br>Note that we do not actually care what the real flow from the iv bag is as of now because we just want the pressure sensor data to match perfectly with the flow sensor data.<br><br>
<br>Hook up the MiDOC in between an IV bag and a 3 ml syringe hooked up to the WPI Pressure infusion pump.
<br>Wait for the pressure to equalize, meaning no flow is going through the sensors.
<br>Run calibrate_flow_test.py on the WPI which runs a 10 minute test that cycles through a variety of flow rates.
<br>sleep(10)
        run_time_min = 10

<br>All of the outlier datasets, (Test 8, 5, and 3) show a higher pressure differential for the same flow rate. Underprediction

This right shifted skew in the residuals show that for higher flow rates, we get a smaller pressure drop than predicted. Overpredicts<br><br><br>The outlier datasets (Tests 8, 5, and 3) exhibit a higher PDiff () for a given flow sensor reading compared to the expected trend, indicating the model underpredicts the flow rate for these pressure differentials.  To understand why, let's explore potential causes, starting with the impact of leaks at different points in the system.<br><br>Consider the system: IV bag →  → 30g needle →  → flow sensor → 30g needle → bucket. A leak diverts some flow, affecting how PDiff and the flow sensor reading align. Let's examine each possible leak location:<br>
<br>
Leak Before  (IV Bag to ):

<br>Total flow: .
<br>Downstream flow: .
<br>PDiff reflects the pressure drop due to , and the flow sensor measures .
<br>Conclusion: A leak before  doesn't explain the higher PDiff for the same flow rate.


<br>
Leak Between  and the First Needle:

<br>Flow at : . Flow after leak: .
<br>PDiff is proportional to , and the flow sensor measures  (assuming no further leaks).
<br>Conclusion: This leak doesn't cause a higher PDiff for the same flow rate.


<br>
Leak Between the First Needle and :

<br>Needle flow: . Flow after leak: , so .
<br>PDiff reflects .
<br>For a given , the actual needle flow is higher (), resulting in a larger PDiff.
<br>Conclusion: This scenario produces a higher PDiff for the same flow sensor reading, matching the outlier behavior.


<br>
Leak Between  and the Flow Sensor:

<br>Needle flow: .  Flow after leak: .
<br>PDiff reflects .
<br>For a given , PDiff corresponds to the larger , increasing PDiff beyond the expected value for .
<br>Conclusion: This also explains the outliers.


<br>
Leak After the Flow Sensor (Before the Second Needle):

<br>This doesn't affect PDiff or .
<br>Conclusion: This doesn't contribute to the outlier behavior.


<br>Leak Summary: Leaks between the first needle and the flow sensor—before or after —are the most likely culprits for the outliers.  PDiff reflects a higher  than , leading to a higher PDiff for a given flow rate. This fits Tests 8, 5, and 3.<br><br>Beyond leaks:<br>
<br>Air Bubbles: Could increase resistance or distort pressure readings.
<br>Sensor Errors:  Overreading pressure sensors or underreading flow sensor could exaggerate PDiff.
<br><br>The residuals plot shows a right-shifted skew: at higher flow rates, the actual PDiff is smaller than predicted, indicating overprediction. Leaks between the needle and flow sensor don't explain this.<br><br>For a 30-gauge needle (~0.15 mm inner diameter), the Reynolds number (Re) helps assess turbulence:  .  Using ,  (water at 23.5°C), and ,   where .<br>
<br>At , ,  (laminar).
<br>At , ,  (turbulent).
<br>Turbulent flow (PDiff ∝ ) transitions from laminar flow (PDiff ∝ Q).  A linear fit might underpredict PDiff's curvature in turbulent flow, but the residuals show overprediction, suggesting flow remains mostly laminar or another factor dominates.<br><br>Higher flow rates could generate frictional heat, lowering viscosity (), but this effect is likely small.<br><br>
<br>Flow Sensor: Underreading at high flow rates could make PDiff appear smaller per reported flow.
<br>Pressure Sensors: Saturation at high pressures could underreport PDiff.
<br><br>Switching to a linear fit didn't eliminate the skew, suggesting the model type isn't the core issue. However, a leak between  and the flow sensor that increases with flow rate offers a compelling explanation. At low flows, the leak is minimal; at high flows, a larger leak reduces  more significantly (), while PDiff reflects . The linear fit overpredicts PDiff at high flows because it doesn't account for the growing .<br><br>The second needle and rolling stopper are unlikely to be the primary causes.<br><br>
<br>Outliers (Underprediction): Leaks between the first needle and the flow sensor are likely the primary cause.
<br>Residuals Skew: A flow-rate-dependent leak, along with potential sensor non-linearity, might explain the skew.

clearly the data is accurate when we don't touch anything, and messes up when we change stuff.<br>
Will need to keep changing the setup and removing sources of error until consecutive batches line up<br><br>During this testing above, we noticed an ADC gap error in the sensiron sensors where the sensor will not output values in a variety of small (0.45 ul/min) flow ranges as shown below:<br>
<img src="lib\media\image-61.png"><br><a href=".?query=tag:TODO" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#TODO</a> Call Sensiron to figure out what is going on and why this isn't in their datasheet<br><br>In this batch, we simply test again, but with the roller at the same location and the height of the bag is changing. This test was once again run with the setup:<br>
<br>bag &gt; iv tube &gt; roller flow modifier &gt; Pressure sensor &gt; microbore tube &gt; 27g needle through duovisc silicone stopper &gt; pressure sensor &gt; large bore tube &gt; Flow sensor &gt; large bore tube &gt; 30g needle<br>
Unfortunately there was a kink in the line between the pressure sensors and flow sensor. Not sure this data will be useable.
<br><br>Same setup as last time with swapped out pressure sensors and removed the kink in the line.<br><br>Due to the kink in the line, we need to redo batch 4.<br>
<img src="lib\media\image-62.png"><br><br>
<br>A silicone injection site for leak free insertions that holds the needle well is necessary instead of our previous idea of inserting the needle through the side of the iv tube.
<br>Ensure there are no kinks in the line!

<br>The slope offset of Pdiff has been resolved by taring in air instead of water which is likely due to small flow rates / oscillations in the fluid when taring in water

The experiment involves:<br>
<br>An IV bag connected to a monitoring system
<br>Rapid raising/lowering of the bag to induce oscillations
<br>Continuous monitoring of:

<br>Pressure readings (P1-P4) in mmHg
<br>Flow rate (Flow Q) in µL/min
<br>Time in seconds


<br><br>The primary objectives are to:<br>
<br>Quantify the amplitude of oscillations in Pressure 3, Pressure 4, and Flow Q
<br>Determine the time required for oscillations to stabilize (past 50 points within 0.1 mmHg of their mean)
<br>Assess the statistical significance of these effects across multiple trials
<br><br>
<br>Data is collected in CSV format with columns: time, pressures, flow rates
<br>Python script analyzes multiple CSV files
<br>Initial oscillation amplitude is calculated from detected peaks in the raw data
<br>Decay time is defined as the first point where the previous 50 points are all within 0.1 mmHg of their mean
<br>Results are visualized with:

<br>Individual plots for each trial showing raw data, peaks, and decay time
<br>Summary box plots of amplitudes and decay times


<br><br>[Results will be automatically generated and saved in the 'iv_bag_analysis_results' directory]<br>
<br>
Individual Trial Plots (plot_file_*.png):

<br>Blue line: Raw data
<br>Black dots: Detected oscillation peaks
<br>Green dashed line: Decay time (when past 50 points are within 0.1 mmHg of their mean)
<br>Black dashed line: Steady-state baseline (mean of last 20% of data)


<br>
Summary Statistics (summary_stats.png):

<br>Box plots showing distribution of:

<br>Oscillation amplitudes for P3, P4, and Flow Q
<br>Decay times for each parameter




<br>
Numerical Results:

<br>Printed to console with averages and standard deviations for:

<br>Oscillation amplitudes
<br>Decay times




<br><br>
<br>Larger amplitudes indicate greater disturbance from bag movement
<br>Longer decay times suggest slower system stabilization (time until past 50 points vary by less than 0.1 mmHg)
<br>Variability across trials (standard deviation) shows consistency of effects
<br>To use:<br>
<br>Run iv_bag_analysis.py
<br>Select your CSV files
<br>Check the results directory for plots and console for numerical summary
<br>Note: For Flow Q (in µL/min), the 0.15 threshold is applied in its native units. If different stability criteria or window sizes are needed, modify the stability_threshold or window_size parameters in the script.<br><br>Pressure 3 (mmHg):<br>

<br><br><br>Effect:<br>
Mitigation:<br><br>Effect: The IV bag swinging on the pole causes a certain amount of pressure fluctuations during the procedure as outlined below. If we have an IV bag with the following characteristics<br>
<br>IV bag height: 10 inches
<br>Swing angle: 10 degrees
<br>Density of the fluid: Assuming it’s water or a similar solution (ρ ≈ 1002 kg/m³)
<br>Gravity: 9.81 m/s²
<br>Pressure sensor is assumed to be at a fixed point below the IV bag.
<br>When the IV bag swings, the vertical position of the lowest point of the bag changes. The height change (Δh) is given by:<br><br>where:<br>
<br> inches (converted to meters: 10 in × 0.0254 = 0.254 m)
<br> (converted to radians: )
<br>Now, calculating:<br>,<br>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;3.86&nbsp;mm)<br>The pressure change due to a height difference Δh\Delta hΔh in a fluid column is:<br>ΔP=ρgΔh\Delta P = \rho g \Delta hΔP=ρgΔh<br>Substituting values:<br>ΔP=(1000&nbsp;kg/m3)×(9.81&nbsp;m/s2)×(0.00386&nbsp;m)\Delta P = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3) \times (9.81 \text{ m/s}^2) \times (0.00386 \text{ m})ΔP=(1000&nbsp;kg/m3)×(9.81&nbsp;m/s2)×(0.00386&nbsp;m) ΔP≈37.8&nbsp;Pa\Delta P \approx 37.8 \text{ Pa}ΔP≈37.8&nbsp;Pa<br><br>Since 1 mmHg ≈ 133.3 Pa,<br>ΔP≈37.8133.3≈0.28&nbsp;mmHg\Delta P \approx \frac{37.8}{133.3} \approx 0.28 \text{ mmHg}ΔP≈133.337.8​≈0.28&nbsp;mmHg<br><br>Effect: The scaling and accuracy of the pressure sensors is documented in the testing: <a data-href="250318 - MiDOC Pressure Sensor Consistency Testing" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\pressure-sensor-consistency-testing\250318-midoc-pressure-sensor-consistency-testing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250318 - MiDOC Pressure Sensor Consistency Testing</a><br>

NOTE: The sensors are not tared so the important attribute of this plot is that the lines are consistent and horizontal, not that they should all lie on the same y value.<br><img src="lib\media\figure_2.png"><br>Overall Average Standard Deviation: 0.03 mm Hg<br>Mitigation: No mitigation is needed on this front as the average standard deviation of these sensors is 0.03 mm Hg.<br><br>Effect: The effect of the temperature on the flow calculation is shown below:<br><br>where:<br>
<br>​ is the sensor’s temperature coefficient (Pa/°C).
<br> is the operating temperature.
<br>​ is the calibration temperature.
<br>If we calibrate the sensor at  and measure the surgical case at , with the temperature coefficient of 0.2% per 10 K, the sensor may have a 0.2% offset.<br>From 70mmHg, this offset would be a 0.14 mm Hg difference. Fortunately, this should cancel out in the flow calculation math and only the pressure drop across the needle would have a 0.2% offset which, with a pressure drop of 5.0mmHg, would then yield a pressure offset of 0.01mmHg.<br>Mitigation: No mitigation is required for the temperature of these sensors as we are largely looking at the offset and therefore the effect of the temperature is minimal.<br><br>Effect: The effect of leveling the devices modifies the pressure sensor data by the following:<br>
<br>
where:<br>
<br> is the height misalignment ()
<br> is gravity (9.81)
<br> is fluid density () (1002 kg/m^3)
<br>The pressure sensors are a maximum distance of 6 inches apart so with a potential incline on the table of 5 degrees, we could have a vertical offset of up to:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>so, therefore, the total inaccuracy between pressure sensors could be:<br>
<br>This would be a dominating factor of the calculation and therefore we must keep the devices level to within 0.1mmHg:<br>
<br>
 Maximum height discrepancy<br>Therefore,  to achieve a pressure sensor accuracy of 0.1mmHg, the devices must be on a table with a maximum slant of:<br>
 <br>Mitigation: We need to ensure the operating table is level prior to completing the test.<br><br>Effect: <br><br>Effect: Air bubbles trapped in the system introduce compliance, reducing the measured pressure difference.<br>
Mitigation: Lines must be purged entirely prior to use of the MiDOC. Failure to do so will result in wildly varying results.<br><br>Effect: Raising the <a data-href="IV bag" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\iv-bag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV bag</a> while being live connected to the pressure sensors creates a large amount of oscillations and data noise that inhibits proper measurement.<br>Mitigation: Using a <a data-href="Stop Cock" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\stop-cock.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stop Cock</a> in between the <a data-href="IV bag" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\iv-bag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV bag</a> and pressure sensors prevents transmission of pressure between the <a data-href="IV bag" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\iv-bag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV bag</a> and Pressure Sensors.<br><br>Effect: Any leak between the pressure sensors or after the pressure sensors in line will overshadow any calculation<br>
