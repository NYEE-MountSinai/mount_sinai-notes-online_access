 <br><br><br>The goal of this test is to understand how the eye responds to fluid and pressure before and after a surgical procedure. By raising the IV bag, we create gentle pressure changes in the eye and record how it responds. Then, we perform a procedure to create a tiny leak in the eye and repeat the pressure changes. This creates signature features in the pressure and flow data that reveals post-operative insights.<br><br>
<br>Setup the MiDOC and insert it into the eye
<br>Create 3 Pressure Impulses by elevating the height of the IV bag to create a signature which captures features such as the ocular compliance / outflow facility of the eye
<br>Continue with the surgical procedure (in this case a 30g needle was inserted into the eye to induce a leak)
<br>Repeat step 2 to capture Pressure and Flow features after the surgical intervention<br>

 <br><br>The MiDOC is an ophthalmic surgical device/setup to collect intra-operative data on the outflow facility and Intraoperative Pressure (IOP) in patients in an attempt to correlate a "successful" surgery to one or more measurable intraoperative parameters. The MiDOC is comprised of 2 pressure sensors and a flow restrictor between them that is connected in-line with an IV bag to measure the change in flow and pressure during surgery. We perform and compare tests both pre- and post-intervention which consist of a series of pressure increase steps to determine the success of the surgery. It has been tested on enucleated porcine eyes to demonstrate its accuracy and is nearing a point where it is ready to begin data collection in real world scenarios. The following documents are ready to review to determine any remaining issues with the functionality of the device.<br><br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jj0n750egq2tl5t6m7f3z/20250324_155843.mp4?rlkey=g6kigk5ohcd50w13bmr7wf8gb&amp;dl=0" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jj0n750egq2tl5t6m7f3z/20250324_155843.mp4?rlkey=g6kigk5ohcd50w13bmr7wf8gb&amp;dl=0" target="_blank">MiDOC Overview Video</a><br>

 <br>Note
This test is to calibrate the Pressure Flow (PF) relationship.<br>
It is not indicative of the actual setup that the MiDOC will be used in!<br>
That test will be done later
<br><br>Develop a relationship between PDiff (P4-P3) and the flow reported by the flow sensor<br>Note that we do not actually care what the real flow from the iv bag is as of now because we just want the pressure sensor data to match perfectly with the flow sensor data.<br><br>
<br>Hook up the MiDOC in between an IV bag and a 3 ml syringe hooked up to the WPI Pressure infusion pump.
<br>Wait for the pressure to equalize, meaning no flow is going through the sensors.
<br>Run calibrate_flow_test.py on the WPI which runs a 10 minute test that cycles through a variety of flow rates.
<br>sleep(10)
        run_time_min = 10
        step_size = (0.1 - 0.001) / ((run_time_min * 60) / (60 + 15))
        for i in np.arange(0.001, 0.1, step_size):
            wpi.setWithdrawRate(i)
            wpi.withdraw()
            sleep(60)
            wpi.stop()
            sleep(15)
        
        # quit the whole program with exception forced python. not qt
        sys.exit(0)
<br><br><br><br>It should not because the flow is allowed to equalize.<br><br>it has no effect<br><img src="lib\media\image-43.png"><br><br>Note
Note: the turn style valves leak
<br><br><img height="355" src="lib\media\image-44.png" style="width: 590px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
this scalar could be explained by there being more air in the line on 250303 which aligns with the greater number of air in line flags.<br><br>Unknown<br><br><br>The scaling discrepancy is caused by out of calibration sensors.<br><br><br>
<br>plug in some pressure sensors
<br>check how different they are from each other in air at the same height
<br><br>
<br>Tare 2 pressure sensors connected to a column of water at a low height
<br>Change the height of the column of water
<br>check to see how off they are
<br><br><br>They can be off by at least 2 mmHg (potentially more) straight out of the box in offset.<br><br>by inspection, it likely isn't scaled, just offset. This will be verified quantitatively later<br>
<img height="374" src="lib\media\image-45.png" style="width: 1096px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>
<br>The height of the IV bag has negligible effect on the Delta P - Flow Correlation
<br>The pressure sensors can be off by at least 2 mmHg straight out of the box in offset which causes varying slopes on the Delta P - Flow Correaltion

<br>the pressure sensors need to be reliably tared

<br>All of the outlier datasets, (Test 8, 5, and 3) show a higher pressure differential for the same flow rate. Underprediction
<br><br><img src="lib\media\image-49.png"><br>
This right shifted skew in the residuals show that for higher flow rates, we get a smaller pressure drop than predicted. Overpredicts<br><br><br>The outlier datasets (Tests 8, 5, and 3) exhibit a higher PDiff () for a given flow sensor reading compared to the expected trend, indicating the model underpredicts the flow rate for these pressure differentials.  To understand why, let's explore potential causes, starting with the impact of leaks at different points in the system.<br><br>Consider the system: IV bag →  → 30g needle →  → flow sensor → 30g needle → bucket. A leak diverts some flow, affecting how PDiff and the flow sensor reading align. Let's examine each possible leak location:<br>
<br>
Leak Before  (IV Bag to ):

<br>Total flow: .
<br>Downstream flow: .
<br>PDiff reflects the pressure drop due to , and the flow sensor measures .
<br>Conclusion: A leak before  doesn't explain the higher PDiff for the same flow rate.


<br>
Leak Between  and the First Needle:

<br>Flow at : . Flow after leak: .
<br>PDiff is proportional to , and the flow sensor measures  (assuming no further leaks).
<br>Conclusion: This leak doesn't cause a higher PDiff for the same flow rate.


<br>
Leak Between the First Needle and :

<br>Needle flow: . Flow after leak: , so .
<br>PDiff reflects .
<br>For a given , the actual needle flow is higher (), resulting in a larger PDiff.
<br>Conclusion: This scenario produces a higher PDiff for the same flow sensor reading, matching the outlier behavior.


<br>
Leak Between  and the Flow Sensor:

<br>Needle flow: .  Flow after leak: .
<br>PDiff reflects .
<br>For a given , PDiff corresponds to the larger , increasing PDiff beyond the expected value for .
<br>Conclusion: This also explains the outliers.


<br>
Leak After the Flow Sensor (Before the Second Needle):

<br>This doesn't affect PDiff or .
<br>Conclusion: This doesn't contribute to the outlier behavior.


<br>Leak Summary: Leaks between the first needle and the flow sensor—before or after —are the most likely culprits for the outliers.  PDiff reflects a higher  than , leading to a higher PDiff for a given flow rate. This fits Tests 8, 5, and 3.<br><br>Beyond leaks:<br>
<br>Air Bubbles: Could increase resistance or distort pressure readings.
<br>Sensor Errors:  Overreading pressure sensors or underreading flow sensor could exaggerate PDiff.
<br><br>The residuals plot shows a right-shifted skew: at higher flow rates, the actual PDiff is smaller than predicted, indicating overprediction. Leaks between the needle and flow sensor don't explain this.<br><br>For a 30-gauge needle (~0.15 mm inner diameter), the Reynolds number (Re) helps assess turbulence:  .  Using ,  (water at 23.5°C), and ,   where .<br>
<br>At , ,  (laminar).
<br>At , ,  (turbulent).
<br>Turbulent flow (PDiff ∝ ) transitions from laminar flow (PDiff ∝ Q).  A linear fit might underpredict PDiff's curvature in turbulent flow, but the residuals show overprediction, suggesting flow remains mostly laminar or another factor dominates.<br><br>Higher flow rates could generate frictional heat, lowering viscosity (), but this effect is likely small.<br><br>
<br>Flow Sensor: Underreading at high flow rates could make PDiff appear smaller per reported flow.
<br>Pressure Sensors: Saturation at high pressures could underreport PDiff.
<br><br>Switching to a linear fit didn't eliminate the skew, suggesting the model type isn't the core issue. However, a leak between  and the flow sensor that increases with flow rate offers a compelling explanation. At low flows, the leak is minimal; at high flows, a larger leak reduces  more significantly (), while PDiff reflects . The linear fit overpredicts PDiff at high flows because it doesn't account for the growing .<br><br>The second needle and rolling stopper are unlikely to be the primary causes.<br><br>
<br>Outliers (Underprediction): Leaks between the first needle and the flow sensor are likely the primary cause.
<br>Residuals Skew: A flow-rate-dependent leak, along with potential sensor non-linearity, might explain the skew.

clearly the data is accurate when we don't touch anything, and messes up when we change stuff.<br>
Will need to keep changing the setup and removing sources of error until consecutive batches line up<br><br>During this testing above, we noticed an ADC gap error in the sensiron sensors where the sensor will not output values in a variety of small (0.45 ul/min) flow ranges as shown below:<br>
<img src="lib\media\image-61.png"><br><a href=".?query=tag:TODO" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#TODO</a> Call Sensiron to figure out what is going on and why this isn't in their datasheet<br><br>In this batch, we simply test again, but with the roller at the same location and the height of the bag is changing. This test was once again run with the setup:<br>
<br>bag &gt; iv tube &gt; roller flow modifier &gt; Pressure sensor &gt; microbore tube &gt; 27g needle through duovisc silicone stopper &gt; pressure sensor &gt; large bore tube &gt; Flow sensor &gt; large bore tube &gt; 30g needle<br>
Unfortunately there was a kink in the line between the pressure sensors and flow sensor. Not sure this data will be useable.
<br><br>Same setup as last time with swapped out pressure sensors and removed the kink in the line.<br><br>Due to the kink in the line, we need to redo batch 4.<br>
<img src="lib\media\image-62.png"> <br><br>
<br>A silicone injection site for leak free insertions that holds the needle well is necessary instead of our previous idea of inserting the needle through the side of the iv tube.
<br>Ensure there are no kinks in the line!

<br>Purge the lines ensuring there is absolutely no air anywhere inline
<br>Secure the sensors to a level surface
<br>Lower the height of the IV bag to 30 mmHg (the lowest mark)<br>
Press start on the MiDOC and add a MiDOC Insertion Comment
<br>Insert the MiDOC
<br>Wait 15 s
<br>Stop the flow using the Stop Cock
<br>Raise the height of the IV bag by 1"
<br>Quickly enable the flow using the stop cock<br>
Add a raise pressure comment
<br>Wait 90 s
<br>Repeat steps (10-13) 9X additional times
<br>Lower the IV bag to the initial height (30 mmHg - the lowest mark)<br>
Continue monitoring and add procedure comments appropriately
<br>Insert a 27g needle into the AC and immediately remove it (to create a leak) repeat steps (9-14).<br>
Stop the MiDOC
<br><br>After each bag raise (pressure increase step), the exponential decay curve of the pressure, and exponential growth curve of the flow are extracted. <br>An exponential curve is fitted to the pressure and flow vs time graphs for each pressure increase step. These exponential curves for the 10 pressure steps before and 10 pressure steps after the creation of the leak is shown in the top two plots in the below figure. <br>The asymptote of this curve is then extracted and used to plot flow vs pressure. There will therefore be 1 flow vs pressure data point for each pressure infusion step. This is shown in the bottom 2 plots in the below figure. <br><img src="lib\media\figure_1-2.png"><br>The steady state pressure values are clearly lower after the procedure, and the flow values are clearly higher (Top two plots). <br>The flow vs pressure graph shows a slope of 0 ul/min/mmHg before the procedure which indicates a good seal and no leak (bottom left plot). <br>The flow vs pressure graph shows a slope of 0.3 ul/min/mmHg after the procedure which indicates a ~18ul/min leak at an IOP of around 20 mmHg (bottom right plot). <br><br>Some are very good, some not so much.

<br><br>The pressure and flow values for each pressure raise step was allowed to reach steady state in this test by waiting for roughly 90 seconds. However, we will not have this much time during an actual human test case. <br>For this reason it was desired to know how the accuracy of the calculated outflow facility changes (as compared to the calculated value using all the data) when only a subset of the pvt and fvt data is used. <br>To determine this, the pvt and fvt plots were trimmed at various times, then the exponential fitting and outlfow calculation was computed using this trimmed data. The resulting outflow facility value was then compared to the value obtained when using the full 90 seconds. <br>The following figure shows the resulting accuracy as a function of the time alloted for each pressure raise step.<br>
<img height="270" src="lib\media\accuracy.png" style="width: 324px; max-width: 100%;"><br>The accuracy seems unstable from 0 to 20 seconds and starts to converge afterwards. <br>This test provoked the change from the initially proposed waiting time of 15 seconds in the procedure with 4 pressure increase steps, to a waiting time of 30 seconds with only 3 pressure infusion steps. Increasing the total test time from 1 minute to 1.5 minutes. <br>The following plots convey the same information as shown at the top of this results discussion but when the data is trimmed at various times. The calculated value for Slope (outflow facility) clearly starts inaccurate and slowly approaches the full time value. <br><img src="lib\media\image-106.png"><br><img src="lib\media\image-107.png"><br><img src="lib\media\image-108.png"><br><img height="789" src="lib\media\image-109.png" style="width: 931px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>The following figures show the raw pvt and fvt plots on top. <br>On bottom is the fitted exponentials overlayed on top of the filtered pvt and fvt data. <br><a data-href="image-84.png" href="attachments\image-84.png" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">image-84.png</a><br>

<br>IOP Calculation from P4
<br><br><br>Effect: Extremely High<br>
Mitigation: Everyone needs to stay still during data collection.<br><br>Effect: The IV bag swinging on the pole causes a certain amount of pressure fluctuations during the procedure as outlined below. If we have an IV bag with the following characteristics<br>
<br>IV bag height: 10 inches
<br>Swing angle: 10 degrees
<br>Density of the fluid: Assuming it’s water or a similar solution (ρ ≈ 1002 kg/m³)
<br>Gravity: 9.81 m/s²
<br>Pressure sensor is assumed to be at a fixed point below the IV bag.
<br>When the IV bag swings, the vertical position of the lowest point of the bag changes. The height change (Δh) is given by:<br><br>where:<br>
<br> inches (converted to meters: )
<br> (converted to radians: )
<br>Now, calculating:<br>&nbsp;<br>The pressure change due to a height difference (Δh) in a fluid column is:<br><br>Substituting values:<br>ΔP=(1000&nbsp;kg/m3)×(9.81&nbsp;m/s2)×(0.00386&nbsp;m) ≈ 37.8&nbsp;Pa ​≈ 0.28&nbsp;mmHg<br>When raising and lowering the IV bag normally, it is unlikely to swing to a full 10 degrees. the amplitude and decay time of oscillations when raising and lowering the IV bag is tested in <a data-href="250318 - MiDOC Bag Oscillation Testing" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\iv-bag-oscillations\250318-midoc-bag-oscillation-testing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250318 - MiDOC Bag Oscillation Testing</a> which finds a maximum decay time of 12 seconds.<br>Mitigation: Wait 15 seconds after raising or lowering the IV bag prior to starting data collection. (Also pass visual inspection that the IV bag is not swinging)<br><br>Effect: High. This would be a dominate effect on the testing.<br>
Mitigation: Ensure no blockages / kinks in the line prior to testing.<br>Example in <a data-href="250307 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship#Compare Batch 4 and Batch 5" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\flow-vs-pressure-testing\250307-midoc-flow-vs-pressure-relationship.html#Compare_Batch_4_and_Batch_5" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250307 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship &gt; Compare Batch 4 and Batch 5</a><br>
The kink in the microbore tubing increased the flow calculations by ~5  for the same pressure drop.<br><br>Effect: The effect of leveling the devices modifies the pressure sensor data by the following:<br>
<br>
where:<br>
<br> is the height misalignment ()
<br> is gravity (9.81)
<br> is fluid density () (1002 kg/m^3)
<br>The pressure sensors are a maximum distance of 6 inches apart so with a potential incline on the table of 5 degrees, we could have a vertical offset of up to:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>so, therefore, the total inaccuracy between pressure sensors could be:<br>
<br>Mitigation: This 0.982 mm Hg would be a dominating factor of the calculation and therefore we must keep the devices level to within 0.1mmHg:<br>
<br>
 Maximum height discrepancy<br>Therefore,  to achieve a pressure sensor accuracy of 0.1mmHg, the devices must be on a table with a maximum slant of:<br>
 <br>We need to ensure the operating table is level prior to completing the test.<br>This was discovered/demonstrated in <a data-href="250310 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship#Batch 4" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\flow-vs-pressure-testing\250310-midoc-flow-vs-pressure-relationship.html#Batch_4" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250310 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship &gt; Batch 4</a> in which the slope of the lines between batches was roughly equivalent but there existed an offset between them of ~5  for the same pressure drop.<br><br>TBD<br><br>Effect: Air bubbles trapped in the system introduce compliance, reducing the measured pressure difference.<br>
Mitigation: Lines must be purged entirely prior to use of the MiDOC. Failure to do so will result in wildly varying results. Further, when priming the <a data-href="Infusion Set" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\infusion-set.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Infusion Set</a>, we must open the air relief valve and squeeze the vial until largely full to ensure no air bubbles get sucked down the iv tube from the falling droplets.<br>This is demonstrated in <a data-href="250310 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship#Batch 3" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\flow-vs-pressure-testing\250310-midoc-flow-vs-pressure-relationship.html#Batch_3" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250310 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship &gt; Batch 3</a> where the flow calculations are off by 10 to 15  between batches when there is air in line. <br><br>Effect: Any leak between the pressure sensors or after the pressure sensors in line will overshadow any calculation<br>
Mitigation: Ensure the calculated flow is near zero when the stop cock is closed prior to the test. Use a proper silicon injection site instead of putting a needle through the side of an IV tube.<br>Was likely the major source of error in <a data-href="250307 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship#Batch 1 and 2" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\flow-vs-pressure-testing\250307-midoc-flow-vs-pressure-relationship.html#Batch_1_and_2" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250307 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship &gt; Batch 1 and 2</a> with a maximum measured difference in flow of around 5 for the same pressure drop <br><br>Effect: Raising the <a data-href="IV Bag" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\iv-bag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV Bag</a> while being connected to the pressure sensors creates a large amount of oscillations and data noise from that inhibits proper measurement.<br>Mitigation: Using a <a data-href="Stop Cock" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\stop-cock.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stop Cock</a> in between the <a data-href="IV Bag" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\iv-bag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV Bag</a> and <a data-href="Pressure Sensor" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\hardware\pressure-sensor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pressure Sensor</a> makes it possible to stop the flow before raising the bag.

Fortunately, this should cancel out in the flow calculation math and only the pressure drop across the needle would have a 0.2% offset which, with a pressure drop of 5.0mmHg, would then yield a pressure offset of 0.01mmHg.<br>Mitigation: No mitigation is required for the temperature of these sensors as we are largely looking at the offset and therefore the effect of the temperature is minimal.<br><br>Could be a contributing source of error in <a data-href="250307 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship#Batch 1 and 2" href="mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\flow-vs-pressure-testing\250307-midoc-flow-vs-pressure-relationship.html#Batch_1_and_2" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">250307 - MiDOC Flow vs Pressure Relationship &gt; Batch 1 and 2</a> with a maximum measured difference in flow of around 5 for the same pressure drop <br>However, this was likely due to a leak between the sensors from not using a proper injection site instead<br><br><br><br>Estimate the pressure drop for 0.5% saline (assume water-like viscosity) flowing through a 22-gauge cannula at 20 µL/min, with inner diameter 0.51 mm and length 1.5 inches (0.0381 m).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>]]></description><link>mount_sinai-notes\projects\midoc\testing\verification\midoc-potential-sources-of-error-analysis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">mount_sinai-notes/projects/MiDOC/Testing/Verification/MiDOC - Potential Sources of Error Analysis.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:19:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\figure_1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\figure_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
