Instantaneous Trapezoidal Calculation of Volume from Flow<br>
Inst. Volume(n) (in μL) = (time(n) - time(n-1)) x (flow(n) + flow(n-1)) / 2

 <br>Questions 1<br>Monday, July 25, 2022<br>9:47 PM<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Q: Are MIGS stent's available in different gauges to vary the outflow coefficient, or is the only option right now to add more stents to increase outflow, and less to decrease it?

<br>
Q: To what extent does the eye regulate IOP on its own?

<br>
How does a healthy eye ensure that the outflow is exactly equal to the inflow?

<br>
Does the TM have some form of biological valve?

<br>
Can the ciliary body regulate the secretion rate of AH?





<br>
Partial A:
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/nips.01443.2003" target="_blank">https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/nips.01443.2003</a>
"the TM has autonomic and sensory innervation (16), which may release different neurotransmitters to modulate TM permeability."
&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Q: In a trabeculectomy, is there any outflow mechanism for drainage of the bleb, or does it act solely as a resoirvoir to bring the IOP back to normal levels.
<br>
A: yes, through the episcleral vessels <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://primaryeyecarect.com/services/glaucoma-care-treatment/filtration-surgery-trabeculectomy" target="_blank">https://primaryeyecarect.com/services/glaucoma-care-treatment/filtration-surgery-trabeculectomy</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Q: In open angle glaucoma, what causes the resistance to outflow in the first place?

<br>
Q:

<br>
In the miDOC documentation, it states
“000_Questions_1_000.png” could not be found.{width="10.979166666666666in" height="1.40625in"}
Didn't the iperfusion paper say that outlow is not linearly proportional to IOP?
“000_Questions_1_001.png” could not be found.{width="8.135416666666666in" height="0.625in"}
&nbsp;
“000_Questions_1_002.png” could not be found.{width="8.6875in" height="1.25in"}
However, iperfusion was performed on ex-vivo mouse eyes, did a more recent study on enucleated human eyes reveal a linear relationship?

 <br>Note
This test is to calibrate the Pressure Flow (PF) relationship.<br>
It is not indicative of the actual setup that the MiDOC will be used in!<br>
That test will be done later
<br><br>Develop a relationship between PDiff (P4-P3) and the flow reported by the flow sensor<br>Note that we do not actually care what the real flow from the iv bag is as of now because we just want the pressure sensor data to match perfectly with the flow sensor data.<br><br>
<br>Hook up the MiDOC in between an IV bag and a 3 ml syringe hooked up to the WPI Pressure infusion pump.
<br>Wait for the pressure to equalize, meaning no flow is going through the sensors.
<br>Run calibrate_flow_test.py on the WPI which runs a 10 minute test that cycles through a variety of flow rates.
<br>sleep(10)
        run_time_min = 10
        step_size = (0.1 - 0.001) / ((run_time_min * 60) / (60 + 15))
        for i in np.arange(0.001, 0.1, step_size):
            wpi.setWithdrawRate(i)
            wpi.withdraw()

this scalar could be explained by there being more air in the line on 250303 which aligns with the greater number of air in line flags.<br><br>Unknown<br><br><br>The scaling discrepancy is caused by out of calibration sensors.<br><br><br>

<br>Tare 2 pressure sensors connected to a column of water at a low height
<br>Change the height of the column of water
<br>check to see how off they are
<br><br><br>They can be off by at least 2 mmHg (potentially more) straight out of the box in offset.<br><br>by inspection, it likely isn't scaled, just offset. This will be verified quantitatively later<br>
<img height="374" src="lib\media\image-45.png" style="width: 1096px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>
<br>The height of the IV bag has negligible effect on the Delta P - Flow Correlation
<br>The pressure sensors can be off by at least 2 mmHg straight out of the box in offset which causes varying slopes on the Delta P - Flow Correaltion

<br>the pressure sensors need to be reliably tared

<br>All of the outlier datasets, (Test 8, 5, and 3) show a higher pressure differential for the same flow rate. Underprediction
<br><br><img src="lib\media\image-49.png"><br>
This right shifted skew in the residuals show that for higher flow rates, we get a smaller pressure drop than predicted. Overpredicts<br><br><br>The outlier datasets (Tests 8, 5, and 3) exhibit a higher PDiff () for a given flow sensor reading compared to the expected trend, indicating the model underpredicts the flow rate for these pressure differentials.  To understand why, let's explore potential causes, starting with the impact of leaks at different points in the system.<br><br>Consider the system: IV bag →  → 30g needle →  → flow sensor → 30g needle → bucket. A leak diverts some flow, affecting how PDiff and the flow sensor reading align. Let's examine each possible leak location:<br>
<br>
Leak Before  (IV Bag to ):

<br>Total flow: .
<br>Downstream flow: .
<br>PDiff reflects the pressure drop due to , and the flow sensor measures .
<br>Conclusion: A leak before  doesn't explain the higher PDiff for the same flow rate.


<br>
Leak Between  and the First Needle:

<br>Flow at : . Flow after leak: .
<br>PDiff is proportional to , and the flow sensor measures  (assuming no further leaks).
<br>Conclusion: This leak doesn't cause a higher PDiff for the same flow rate.


<br>
Leak Between the First Needle and :

<br>Needle flow: . Flow after leak: , so .
<br>PDiff reflects .
<br>For a given , the actual needle flow is higher (), resulting in a larger PDiff.
<br>Conclusion: This scenario produces a higher PDiff for the same flow sensor reading, matching the outlier behavior.


<br>
Leak Between  and the Flow Sensor:

<br>Needle flow: .  Flow after leak: .
<br>PDiff reflects .
<br>For a given , PDiff corresponds to the larger , increasing PDiff beyond the expected value for .
<br>Conclusion: This also explains the outliers.


<br>
Leak After the Flow Sensor (Before the Second Needle):

<br>This doesn't affect PDiff or .
<br>Conclusion: This doesn't contribute to the outlier behavior.


<br>Leak Summary: Leaks between the first needle and the flow sensor—before or after —are the most likely culprits for the outliers.  PDiff reflects a higher  than , leading to a higher PDiff for a given flow rate. This fits Tests 8, 5, and 3.<br><br>Beyond leaks:<br>
<br>Air Bubbles: Could increase resistance or distort pressure readings.
<br>Sensor Errors:  Overreading pressure sensors or underreading flow sensor could exaggerate PDiff.
<br><br>The residuals plot shows a right-shifted skew: at higher flow rates, the actual PDiff is smaller than predicted, indicating overprediction. Leaks between the needle and flow sensor don't explain this.<br><br>For a 30-gauge needle (~0.15 mm inner diameter), the Reynolds number (Re) helps assess turbulence:  .  Using ,  (water at 23.5°C), and ,   where .<br>
<br>At , ,  (laminar).
<br>At , ,  (turbulent).
<br>Turbulent flow (PDiff ∝ ) transitions from laminar flow (PDiff ∝ Q).  A linear fit might underpredict PDiff's curvature in turbulent flow, but the residuals show overprediction, suggesting flow remains mostly laminar or another factor dominates.<br><br>Higher flow rates could generate frictional heat, lowering viscosity (), but this effect is likely small.<br><br>
<br>Flow Sensor: Underreading at high flow rates could make PDiff appear smaller per reported flow.
<br>Pressure Sensors: Saturation at high pressures could underreport PDiff.
<br><br>Switching to a linear fit didn't eliminate the skew, suggesting the model type isn't the core issue. However, a leak between  and the flow sensor that increases with flow rate offers a compelling explanation. At low flows, the leak is minimal; at high flows, a larger leak reduces  more significantly (), while PDiff reflects . The linear fit overpredicts PDiff at high flows because it doesn't account for the growing .<br><br>The second needle and rolling stopper are unlikely to be the primary causes.<br><br>
<br>Outliers (Underprediction): Leaks between the first needle and the flow sensor are likely the primary cause.
<br>Residuals Skew: A flow-rate-dependent leak, along with potential sensor non-linearity, might explain the skew.

clearly the data is accurate when we don't touch anything, and messes up when we change stuff.<br>
Will need to keep changing the setup and removing sources of error until consecutive batches line up<br><br>During this testing above, we noticed an ADC gap error in the sensiron sensors where the sensor will not output values in a variety of small (0.45 ul/min) flow ranges as shown below:<br>
<img src="lib\media\image-61.png"><br><a href=".?query=tag:TODO" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#TODO</a> Call Sensiron to figure out what is going on and why this isn't in their datasheet<br><br>In this batch, we simply test again, but with the roller at the same location and the height of the bag is changing. This test was once again run with the setup:<br>
<br>bag &gt; iv tube &gt; roller flow modifier &gt; Pressure sensor &gt; microbore tube &gt; 27g needle through duovisc silicone stopper &gt; pressure sensor &gt; large bore tube &gt; Flow sensor &gt; large bore tube &gt; 30g needle<br>
Unfortunately there was a kink in the line between the pressure sensors and flow sensor. Not sure this data will be useable.
<br><br>Same setup as last time with swapped out pressure sensors and removed the kink in the line.<br><br>Due to the kink in the line, we need to redo batch 4.<br>
<img src="lib\media\image-62.png"><br><br>
<br>A silicone injection site for leak free insertions that holds the needle well is necessary instead of our previous idea of inserting the needle through the side of the iv tube.
<br>Ensure there are no kinks in the line!

 <br>Dynamic Ocular Tonometry Study during Intraocular Surgery<br>Principal Investigator: Gautam Kamthan, MD<br>Funded by: New York Eye and Ear Infirmary Foundation/MSIP<br>February 6, 2025<br><br><br><br><br><br>To study ocular outflow dynamics (see appendix for definition and discussion of ocular outflow) of the eye using intraoperative tonographic biometry and assess its predictive value in improving postoperative outcomes<br><br>Measured post-operative IOP up to Day 90 and its correlation to intraoperative ocular outflow and IOP biometry in patients undergoing concomitant intraocular surgery<br><br>Understanding intraoperative ocular outflow may have post-operative predictive management value to avoid immediate post-operative complications and improve outcomes<br><br><br>There are no current metrics to connect intraoperative findings to post-operative outcomes for intraocular surgeries that modify outflow. Abnormally high or low intraocular pressure (IOP) may occur after these surgeries and are due to an ocular outflow problem; yet, outflow is not directly measured at any point during a patient’s care. IOP is used as a proxy for ocular outflow, but is still not truly representative and is inadequate for outflow assessments. Many intraocular surgeries such as glaucoma, cataract, and retina surgeries modify ocular outflow but patients suffer from immediate post-operative complications from abnormal IOP because the outflow homeostasis of the eye is unknown.<br>Complications from abnormal IOP may result in permanent vision loss, suboptimal surgical outcomes, and unnecessary repeat surgeries. Therefore, we would like to measure the ocular outflow during surgery to better inform surgeons of post-operative management and outcomes.<br><br>The main purpose of glaucoma surgery is to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP). However, it is difficult to know how well the surgery will achieve this with current methods. As a result, patients may have high or low IOP in the post-operative period. In the case of trabeculectomy, for example, the rate of hypotony (too low IOP) has been reported to exceed 30% with a significant risk of follow-on complications. For glaucoma patients undergoing cataract surgery, the most common eye surgery worldwide, as many as 28% of cases with co-morbid glaucoma demonstrate abnormally high IOP over 30 mmHg and more than 50% experience IOP over 25 mmHg.<br>These abnormal IOP fluctuations place patients at risk for vision loss or suboptimal post-operative results. It has been studied that the utility of the standard day 1 post-operative visit after cataract surgery is indicated primarily to check for and treat high or low post-operative IOPs. Thus, having better control and prediction of the post-operative IOP could reduce the need for this potentially unnecessary office visit, which became especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>Currently, there are no clinically useful bio-markers to predict the IOP post-operatively. While intraocular pressure measurement pre, peri and intra-operatively has been described, it is not efficient because of many confounding factors, and it does not closely correlate with the eye’s outflow facility. Simple intraoperative tonometry has not been useful either as it is not a sufficient surrogate for outflow capacity estimation, only predicting the immediate IOP, without relation to the post-operative steady-state outflow capacity. The most common devices used to measure IOP, tonometers, themselves typically also suffer from inaccuracy in their readings from a number of factors, such as corneal edema, which is common during eye surgery. Surprisingly, the current, most common standard method for assessing outflow intraoperatively is visual and tactile inspection by the surgeon. That is, the surgeon observes the amount of fluid leaking, palpates the eye, and estimates whether the amount is too much, too little, or acceptable. This makes it difficult to understand the outflow of intraocular fluid or pressure regulation in a dynamic system such as the eye.<br>Prior studies have assessed outflow capacity based on animal, cadaveric, or mathematical modeling. Few have performed an in-vivo evaluation of the IOP and outflow capacity. The team of Karyotakis et al (see attached reference) performed in-vivo measurements during routine cataract surgery in 19 patients. Patients had a baseline measurement taken upon entry into the eye, followed by an infusion of saline to pressurize the eye up to 40 mmHg, and then the IOP decay curve was graphed to calculate the ocular outflow.&nbsp; This study was important in advancing the knowledge of ocular outflow, but it was limited in its scope in a variety of ways aside from the small sample size:<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It only assessed the outflow at the beginning of the surgical procedure. No measurements were taken during the cataract surgery and none were taken at the end.<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No correlation was made to post-operative outcomes. No post-operative data was collected or evaluated.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only healthy eyes undergoing cataract surgery were studied.&nbsp; Glaucoma is a disease of ocular outflow and as such glaucoma surgery is entirely focused on modifying the outflow.&nbsp; These patients, however, were excluded in addition to all other patients with other disease entities.<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data analysis was purely mathematical as it was published in 2015. Given recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), there may be patterns or findings that went unnoticed without the aid of such technology.<br>Therefore, we propose this study to measure the IOP fluid dynamics and outflow homeostasis in patients undergoing intraocular surgery to understand how post-operative surgical success can be optimized and complications prevented.<br><br><br>Intraoperative tonography and fluid biometry to determine the ocular outflow can be predictive of post-operative outflow and abnormal IOP<br><br>Prospective observational study, Single-Site<br><br>Recruit physicians affiliated with the Mount Sinai Health System who are performing intraocular surgeries, such as cataract and/or glaucoma surgeries. Enroll patients to undergo concomitant IOP measurement and outflow capacity calculation during their surgery. Monitor IOP post-operatively for up to 90 days. Single study arm<br><br>Measurements will be collected and surgical management of the patients will not be influenced based on measurements as surgeons will be blinded to them during the surgery. Measurements will be taken using an FDA-registered, sterile, single-use, disposable Deltran I pressure sensor designed for measuring physiological pressures of the body. The sensor will be attached to an infusion line communicating to an infusion source at a point out of the sterile field. It outputs measurement data electronically to Microsoft Excel. Computations and analysis will be performed with standard software such as Microsoft Excel.<br><br>Risk will be low by design because measurement of IOP during surgery will occur through existing incisions created for the surgery itself.<br><br>Patients will be stratified according to disease entity (glaucoma and/or cataract), severity (mild, moderate, etc), and surgery performed (cataract surgery, cataract surgery combined with glaucoma surgery, trabeculectomy, and/or glaucoma device implantation)<br><br>Up to 150 people enrolled or a predictive model of post-operative IOP is established. Therefore, if a predictive model is determined prior to 150 people, the study will end.<br><br><br>Surgery provides an opportunity to directly measure ocular outflow. Current methods are all indirect, such as measuring static IOP with a tonometer depressing the cornea.&nbsp; Outflow modifying surgeries, such as cataract and glaucoma surgeries, also present opportunities to study how different interventions can modify the outflow.<br><br>As only measurements will be taken, no "intervention" is being performed to affect the outcome of the surgery or patient's care.&nbsp; The surgeon is masked to the findings during the surgery so will be unable to make intraoperative surgical management changes to care. Therefore this is observational. As this is observational, a control is not needed.&nbsp; An observational design has been chosen to collect data to develop a predictive model of post-operative findings without influencing them.<br>While this is an observational study, that refers to the design.&nbsp; The study itself sometimes involves pressurization of the eye that may occur to obtain some measurements, which is not a passive observational measurement.<br>Follow-up will be for 90 days as this will allow patients' IOP to stabilize after the acute post-operative period of 30 days.<br><br><br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sterile, single-use, disposable pressure sensor (Deltran I Disposable Pressure Transducer) will be attached to a stable location within the sterile field as close as possible to the subject’s eye without interfering with the surgeon’s access, such as underneath the eyelid speculum temporally near the subject’s temporal orbital rim aka the side of their head.<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensor will connect fluidically to the anterior chamber using a standard off-the-shelf 20G Lewicky Anterior Chamber Maintainer that is already available at the hospital via a luer lock<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensor will be fixated in the sterile field by the surgeon using tegaderms or other standard sterile fixation material<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensor will communicate to the infusion source (such as a sterile bag of BSS hung on an IV pole) via tubing that will extend off the sterile field.<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surgeon will connect these components (sensor, AC maintainer, and IV tubing) via luer locks under the guidance of the study staff.&nbsp; Surgeons have adequate training in making these connections as they regularly use luer lock connections as a part of standard care<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to insertion into the eye through a clear corneal paracentesis, the tubing will be primed to eliminate any air bubbles and ensure a continuous laminar column of fluid<br><br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measurements will be taken during the surgery through the existing paracentesis that is necessarily created to perform the surgery itself<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anterior chamber maintainer will be periodically inserted through the incision at the beginning, during, and end of the surgery, at the surgeon’s discretion<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other sources of infusion, such as a phacoemulsification handpiece, will be removed from the eye prior to taking measurements<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measurements will be recorded using the pressure sensor as it is connected in-line with infusion tubing<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressure sensor is designed to measure the pressure in-line and be reflective of the pressure measured at the distal tip of the tubing. This is because the flow in the tubing is laminar and the height differential between the sensor and the point of the tip (the anterior chamber) will be accounted for through calibration.<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Periodic measurements and infusions to characterize the outflow capacity (facility) will be performed at the surgeon’s discretion<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The infusion will consist of raising the height of the pole with the infusion bag to an appropriate height to pressurize the eye to a desired value no greater than 40mmHg (as was done in the study by Karyotakis et al) or as dictated by the surgeon, such as in the case of a glaucoma patient. Once the pressure reaches the desired value, the infusion line will be closed and the decay of the eye pressure monitored. Measurements will be continuously taken before, during, and after the infusion. At any point, the surgeon can stop the measurements at their discretion. Should the IOP not decay and stay elevated, for example at 40 mmHg, the surgeon/study staff can stop pressurization and drain fluid from an existing incision to decrease the IOP to an appropriate value.<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensor is designed to output measurements electronically<br><br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgeon will remove the AC maintainer from the eye at their discretion, at least at the conclusion of surgery<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All equipment is single-use, sterile, and disposable, except for the AC maintainer that is reusable and designed to be resterilized.<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disposable equipment will be discarded according to the standard appropriate waste protocols<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AC maintainer will be sent for resterilization according to the hospital’s standard policy<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total time for measurements will take less than 10 minutes<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measurements that have been collected will be analyzed using standard software such as Microsoft Excel<br><br><br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Ophthalmic surgeons performing intraocular surgery within the Mount Sinai Health System will consent subjects and enroll patients prior to surgery in a preoperative visit. Subjects will be informed of the study and can sign the consent form or if they choose to can sign the consent form at a later date.<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; No screening is required as the surgeons themselves will be identifying subjects<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients will be consented by the surgeon/surgeon’s staff in a language they understand<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; All surgeons will be added to the study team prior to participation<br><br>Individuals undergoing cataract and/or glaucoma surgery in the Mount Sinai Health System<br><br>Individuals less than 18 years old, pregnant women, those without capacity to make their own decisions, and prisoners<br><br>Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time. After the surgery is complete, the patient will be followed by the surgeon for their post-operative care and their IOP measurements will be collected at each visit as a part of standard care. These measurements can be collected from the patient's medical record without interacting with the patient during the post-operative period. As this collection of data from the record will cause no modification to their standard care, it is less likely that patients will voluntarily withdraw from the study; nonetheless, should they choose to, they can withdraw at any time. Pre-operative measurements will be collected from chart review.<br>For patients who require further incisional surgeries due to complications from the first surgery, the measurements will stop. &nbsp;If additional in-office procedures are required, then in-office measurements can continue according to the schedule.<br>If, during the surgery, a patient becomes unstable while measurements are being taken, measurements will be halted. The surgeon may restart measurements once the patient is stabilized or aborted completely per the surgeon’s discretion.<br><br>Patients in the study will be participating in their surgeon’s regular post-operative care and will be required by the surgeon to follow-up, which will aid to minimize loss to follow-up. Patients who have not followed-up or miss a visit will be contacted by the surgeon’s office to remind them of follow-up.<br><br><br>Periodically, such as after the first 10 cases, the data and cases will be reviewed to determine if a predictive algorithm can be identified and if any safety concerns are noted. Once a predictive algorithm is identified, the study is complete. If any safety concerns are noted at such a time point as well, the study may be modified or discontinued as necessary.<br>Surgeons will be the ultimate decision-makers regarding the safety of their patients, as they will know their patients’ medical conditions best. As such, the safety of patients included in the study will be monitored by their surgeons in concert with study staff. &nbsp;As patients will be undergoing surgery as recommended by their surgeon to treat an existing condition, such as cataracts or glaucoma, the post-operative care and safety will be dictated by the surgeon.<br>Adverse events (AE) will be defined as those events that negatively affect the patient’s health specifically as a result of the study.&nbsp; As there is no intervention (no additional incisions and no medication or surgical procedure performed), an AE must be clearly related to the study and not to the surgery itself.&nbsp; Adverse events will be monitored and recorded as they relate to the patient’s outcome from the surgery. Surgeons will report to study staff any adverse events immediately as they are identified. The management will be according to the treating physician.&nbsp;<br><br><br>The risks of standard intraocular surgery exist and are unavoidable for surgery. &nbsp;Intraoperative tonometry will be performed through the incision created for the surgery. &nbsp;There will be minimal additional risk, as such measurement is not a routine part of surgery but is unlikely to affect the surgical outcome.<br>Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS) is known to occur unpredictably in routine, uncomplicated ophthalmic surgeries. Most commonly, it is due to improperly cleaned reusable instruments (Mamalis N). It has also been found to occur in cases due to BSS that was prepared in the hospital pharmacy (Andonegui). As TASS is a known risk in all eye surgery, the occurrence of TASS may not be associated with the study and may be coincidental. However, since reusable anterior chamber maintainers will be used and sterilized according to the hospital's standard protocol, their use could theoretically increase the risk of TASS. &nbsp;Other equipment is sterile, single-use, and disposable. BSS will not be prepared in the hospital pharmacy and will only be used that is directly purchased from the manufacturers.<br>No published data exists on increased risks associated with increasing ophthalmic surgical time for less than 10 minutes (Cheng et al). Neither are there data on risks associated with artificially pressurizing the eye during surgery up to 40 mmHg as will be done in the study.&nbsp; Should a surgeon feel such pressurization could cause harm, the pressurization can be modified to the surgeon’s choosing or aborted completely at any time.&nbsp; For reference, phacoemulsification machines, such as the Alcon Centurion, that are commonly used at the hospital are set by default to pressurize the eye up to 70 mmHg.<br><br>A predictive model may be developed to inform surgeons of better surgical and post-operative management strategies, including potential pre-operative risk-stratification. This model may provide better outcomes for patients and reduce complications from surgeries in the future.<br><br><br>Hypothesis<br>Intraoperative ocular outflow measurements using tonography are predictive of post-operative findings such as IOP<br>Null Hypothesis<br>Intraoperative dynamic tonometry measurements and their tracing are not predictive of postoperative IOP states and major IOP fluctuations (hypotony and hypertension episodes)<br><br>A potentially predictive model is developed correlating the intraoperative IOP dynamic tonometric measurements and their tracing to the post-operative IOP state.<br>Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)<br>Incidence and rate of adverse events such as IOP spikes and hypotony as a byproduct of the surgery itself<br><br>This is a preliminary feasibility and exploratory study which will use standard statistical analytical methods, followed by a machine learning model to correlate intraoperative biometry data to post-operative outcomes.

The aqueous humor is the fluid created by the eye itself to serve a variety of purposes ranging from nutritional support to providing an optically clear medium for light transmission to facilitate vision.&nbsp;<br>When there is disharmony between the rate of aqueous humor production and the rate that the aqueous humor leaves the eye, there exists an abnormality in ocular outflow. For example, if the rate of aqueous humor leaving the eye is less than the rate of production, then the outflow is low.<br>One such manifestation of abnormal outflow is an abnormal IOP. In the example above, if the outflow of the eye is low and the rate of production is high, then the IOP would be high. The reverse would also be true.&nbsp; In disease states such as glaucoma, people often have a low outflow and a high IOP.<br>Outflow and IOP are related but not equivalent, however. Outflow is a dynamic process; whereas, IOP is discussed in static terms. It is similar to the relationship between acceleration and the speed (technically velocity) of a car. For example, a car may have a high speed, but not be accelerating quickly if it is maintaining a constant speed. On the other hand, a car may be accelerating very quickly but the speed at that moment may be low.&nbsp; Therefore, IOP provides only a limited snapshot of the eye’s ability to manage its aqueous humor flow.&nbsp; As such we chose to examine ocular outflow in this study as it is a much better description of the eye’s aqueous humor flow regulation.<br>We will still utilize methods of determining the IOP, such as with a pressure sensor, to obtain ocular outflow.&nbsp; For example, we will graph the IOP over time to generate an IOP curve. Then to determine the outflow, we will, in simple terms, take the derivative of the IOP curve.<br>Collecting intraoperative information on the outflow of the eye in this manner and correlating it to the post-operative measurements, using IOP at each visit as a proxy, will hopefully explain why some people develop post-operative complications related to an abnormal IOP (and outflow) and others do not.<br>See references below for further technical discussion and details.<br><br>Sherwood JM, Reina-Torres E, Bertrand JA, Rowe B, Overby DR.

 <br><br><br>Date: October 24, 2024  <br><br><br>To determine if one or more of the two (2) C-Rex outer wall wires (images below) will modify (i.e., cut or debride) the outer wall of the Schlemm’s Canal such that the outflow rate of the eye increases.<br><br>The teeth/points of these wires are intended to bear against the back wall of the canal as they are advanced into the Schlemm’s Canal and again when they are retracted.<br><br>Effects of two (2) different wire designs shall be quantified by recording outflow/perfusion rate before and after treatment (i.e., baseline perfusion versus perfusion after extension of the wire into the canal). Each globe will then undergo a 90-degree goniotomy and the perfusion rate will again be recorded.<br>After completion of perfusion rate testing, three (3) treated and untreated locations shall be evaluated via histology to assess if there is a noticeable difference in cell layers along the deployment path of the wires.<br>In parallel with the above evaluations, another globe will be baselined for perfusion rate and then undergo a 90-degree goniotomy, while still another globe will be baselined and undergo a 360-degree goniotomy.<br><br>
<br>UNIT A - PN 300482  
<br>UNIT C - PN 300485  
<br><br>
<br>No age or sex rule outs
<br>Must be collected from non-Asian population
<br>Serology negative for Hepatitis B/C and HIV
<br>No IOLs
<br>No evidence of prior eye surgeries
<br><br>
<br>
Baseline Perfusion Rate:<br>
Determine initial baseline perfusion rates for each eye.<br>
Tissue bank will collect four (4) pairs of donor globes.<br>
The container of each eye should be numbered where the number represents the donor and the suffix letter represents which eye (1R, 1L, 2R, 2L, 3R, 3L, 4R, 4L).<br>
For each globe, conduct baseline perfusion testing per the Tissue Lab Perfusion Rate test protocol.<br>
Record perfusion rate results.  

<br>
Outer Wall Treatment:<br>
Repeat perfusion rate testing on globes after deployment of wires.<br>
For each of the 2 wire designs, perform the following steps on 3 different globes as per the table below:  

<br>Create a main corneal incision.  
<br>Insert the instrument into the eye and enter the Trabecular Meshwork (TM) directly across from the main incision.  
<br>Once the cannula is in place, insert the wire in the counterclockwise direction into the Schlemm’s Canal (SC) and extend it through the entire length of the slider.  
<br>Carefully retract the wire.  
<br>Seal the incision in the TM as well as the main corneal incision.  
<br>Repeat the perfusion rate test and record results.  


<br>
Control:<br>
Repeat steps b - g using one of the wires, except do not extend the wire into the Schlemm’s Canal. Insert the wire far enough to create a similar disruption or cut into the TM.  

<br>
Goniotomy:<br>
Perform a 90-degree goniotomy using a C-Rex instrument (CRX-100, CRX-101, or CRX-121) for each treated eye in the same area as the outer wall treatment.<br>
Repeat the perfusion rate test and record results.  

<br>
Goniotomy Only:<br>
Perform a 90-degree goniotomy on one untreated pair of eyes and a 360-degree goniotomy on the other untreated pair.<br>
Conduct perfusion rate test and record results.

<br>
Histology Prep:<br>
After testing is completed, fix and prep each treated eye for histology.<br>
Histology sectioning should be made at specified locations per the illustration. Ensure orientation of the main incision is noted and images are recorded.

<br><br><br><br>The illustration below shows the relative positions which should be visualized in order to assess how much effect the Iantrek instruments had on the outer wall of the Schlemm’s Canal.<br><br><br>
<br>25 gauge butterfly needle with attached tubing
<br>1mL sterile syringe
<br>Ring stand and clamp
<br>Nest cup for holding eye

<br>5mM glucose PBS (37C)
<br>Hemostat
<br>Large pair of forceps
<br>Lab tape
<br>1mL Tip box with lid
<br>Kimwipes
<br><br>
<br>Warm 5mM glucose PBS to 37C.  
<br>Prep working area in a sterile hood.  
<br>Set up ring stand with a clamp for securing a 1ml syringe.  
<br>Attach needle tubing to syringe and place syringe in clamp, ensuring it is 20cm above the limbus.  
<br>Gently draw 5mM glucose PBS up through the needle and syringe, avoiding bubbles.  
<br>Clamp tubing with hemostat and fill syringe completely with PBS.  
<br>Gently place the globe into the jar.  
<br>Unclamp tubing and insert needle into the anterior chamber.  
<br>Tape tubing to maintain needle position.  
<br>Refill syringe at 5 minutes post-insertion and start timer.  
<br>Notate fluid level at 15-minute intervals for 2 hours.

<br>Repeat steps (10-13) 2X additional times<br>
Add a test end comment
<br>Lower the IV bag to the initial height (30 mmHg - the lowest mark)<br>
Continue monitoring and add procedure comments appropriately
<br>Quickly enable flow through Stop Cock 2 and (i.e. ) repeat steps (9-15) once.<br>
Stop the MiDOC
<br><br><br>Need to ensure every connection makes sense (e.g. luer locks fit together)<br>
Purging the line after the silicone injection port requires a time delay that is a function of volume after the injection port. Using a thinner iv tubing would be helpful.<br><br>  Labels = {<br>
